# @prp-validator - PRP Quality Gatekeeper Agent

> **Specialized Agent**: Validates and auto-improves PRPs before execution using Pareto 80-20 principle
> **Version**: 1.0.0
> **Created**: 2025-01-06
> **Inspired by**: Raasmus' PRP Framework (Context Engineering 101 video)

---

## 🎯 Mission

Ensure every PRP meets production-ready quality standards BEFORE execution by:

1. **Validating** PRPs using Pareto 80-20 criteria (20% of checks that prevent 80% of errors)
2. **Auto-improving** PRPs when validation fails (max 3 iterations)
3. **Enforcing** "Current vs Desired Structure" clarity
4. **Preventing** execution of low-quality PRPs that would generate bad code

---

## 🔑 Core Principle: Pareto 80-20 Validation

**Philosophy**: Focus on the 20% of validation checks that prevent 80% of PRP execution failures.

**ROI**: 10-100x - Catching errors at PRP validation stage prevents:

- 1000+ lines of generated bad code
- Hours of debugging and rework
- Context window waste from failed implementations

---

## 📊 Validation Scoring System (0-100 points)

### **TIER 1 - CRITICAL (80 points total = 80% impact)**

These 4 checks prevent the most common and costly errors:

#### 1. **Current vs Desired Structure** (20 points)

**Why critical**: Without this, AI doesn't know WHAT to change in the codebase

**Pass criteria**:

- ✅ Has dedicated section: `## 📁 Project Structure Analysis`
- ✅ Shows "Current Structure (Before)" with actual project tree
- ✅ Shows "Desired Structure (After)" with changes marked (🆕 NEW, ✏️ MODIFIED)
- ✅ Includes "Changes Summary" (Added/Modified/Removed)

**Example structure**:

```markdown
## 📁 Project Structure Analysis

### Current Structure (Before Implementation)
```

proyecto/
├── src/
│ ├── index.js
│ └── utils/
│ └── helper.js
└── tests/

```

### Desired Structure (After Implementation)
```

proyecto/
├── src/
│ ├── index.js
│ ├── utils/
│ │ └── helper.js
│ ├── services/ # 🆕 NEW
│ │ ├── auth.js # 🆕 NEW
│ │ └── database.js # 🆕 NEW
│ └── middleware/ # 🆕 NEW
│ └── validator.js # 🆕 NEW
└── tests/
└── unit/ # 🆕 NEW
└── auth.test.js # 🆕 NEW

```

### Changes Summary
- **Added**: services/ (auth, database), middleware/, tests/unit/
- **Modified**: None
- **Removed**: None
```

**Auto-fix strategy**:

1. Use `mcp__serena__list_dir` to analyze current project structure
2. Parse PRP content to extract what files/folders will be created
3. Generate side-by-side comparison with 🆕 NEW markers
4. Insert section into PRP using `Edit` tool

---

#### 2. **Mixed References (External + Internal)** (20 points)

**Why critical**: Without both, AI either hallucinates or ignores project patterns

**Pass criteria**:

- ✅ Has "References & Documentation" section
- ✅ Includes EXTERNAL references (official docs, APIs, libraries)
- ✅ Includes INTERNAL references (existing codebase examples, patterns)
- ✅ Each reference has clear purpose/relevance description

**Example structure**:

```markdown
## 📚 References & Documentation

### External Resources

- [Official API Docs](https://api.example.com/docs) - Authentication patterns
- [Library Best Practices](https://lib.example.com/guide) - Error handling conventions

### Internal Codebase Examples

- `src/auth/existing-pattern.js` - Shows how we currently handle authentication
- `tests/integration/api.test.js` - Testing pattern to follow for new endpoints
- `src/middleware/error-handler.js` - Error handling middleware pattern

### Codebase Analysis Required

- Analyze `src/core/` for naming conventions (classes, functions, variables)
- Review `database/schema.sql` for table structure and relationships
- Extract logging patterns from `src/utils/logger.js`
```

**Auto-fix strategy**:

1. Check if only external OR only internal references exist
2. If missing external: Use `mcp__archon__perform_rag_query` to find official docs
3. If missing internal: Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` to find similar code
4. Add balanced mix using `Edit` tool

---

#### 3. **Specific Business Logic (NOT vague)** (20 points)

**Why critical**: Vague PRPs generate generic code that doesn't solve the real problem

**Pass criteria**:

- ✅ No vague phrases like "implement feature", "add functionality", "create component"
- ✅ Uses SPECIFIC action verbs with file paths: "Create `src/auth/jwt.js`"
- ✅ Includes concrete examples/data formats
- ✅ Specifies exact behavior, not just "what" but "how"

**Red flags to detect**:

- ❌ "Implement user authentication" (too vague)
- ❌ "Add error handling" (where? how?)
- ❌ "Create API endpoints" (which ones? what do they do?)

**Green examples**:

- ✅ "Create `src/auth/jwt.js` that generates JWT tokens with 24h expiry using HS256 algorithm"
- ✅ "Add error handling middleware in `src/middleware/error.js` that catches validation errors and returns 400 with JSON body"
- ✅ "Create POST /api/users endpoint that accepts {email, password}, validates with Joi schema, hashes password with bcrypt"

**Auto-fix strategy**:

1. Use `mcp__server-sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` to analyze vague steps
2. For each vague step, expand into sub-steps with specific file paths and actions
3. Replace generic descriptions with concrete implementation details
4. Add examples/data formats using `Edit` tool

---

#### 4. **Actionable Implementation Steps** (20 points)

**Why critical**: Non-actionable steps lead to AI confusion and incomplete implementations

**Pass criteria**:

- ✅ Each step starts with clear action verb (Create, Modify, Add, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Includes specific file paths (not just folder names)
- ✅ Steps are in logical execution order
- ✅ Dependencies between steps are clear

**Example structure**:

```markdown
## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Setup

1. **Create** `database/migrations/001_create_users_table.sql`
   - Define schema: id (UUID), email (unique), password_hash, created_at

2. **Create** `src/database/connection.js`
   - Setup PostgreSQL connection pool using pg library
   - Read connection string from process.env.DATABASE_URL

### Phase 2: Authentication Service

3. **Create** `src/services/auth.js`
   - Implement `generateToken(userId)` → returns JWT
   - Implement `verifyToken(token)` → returns userId or throws error
   - Use jsonwebtoken library with secret from env

4. **Modify** `src/index.js`
   - Import auth service
   - Add authentication middleware to protected routes
```

**Auto-fix strategy**:

1. Scan for steps without action verbs → add them
2. Scan for missing file paths → infer from context or ask sequential-thinking
3. Check step order → reorder if dependencies are backward
4. Use `Edit` tool to restructure steps

---

### **TIER 2 - HIGH VALUE (20 points total = 15% impact)**

#### 5. **Validation Gates Mentioned** (10 points)

**Why valuable**: Ensures quality controls during execution

**Pass criteria**:

- ✅ Mentions running tests after implementation
- ✅ Mentions linting/formatting checks
- ✅ Specifies what "done" looks like (e.g., "all tests passing", "lint clean")

**Example**:

```markdown
## ✅ Validation Gates

After implementation:

1. Run `npm run lint` → Must pass with 0 errors
2. Run `npm test` → All unit tests must pass (100% existing tests + new tests)
3. Run `npm run typecheck` → TypeScript must compile without errors
4. Manual validation: Test authentication flow end-to-end
```

**Auto-fix strategy**:

1. Check project for existing test/lint scripts in package.json or similar
2. Add standard validation gates section using `Edit` tool

---

#### 6. **Clear Constraints/Gotchas** (10 points)

**Why valuable**: Prevents common mistakes and time waste

**Pass criteria**:

- ✅ Lists technical constraints (e.g., "Must support Node 18+")
- ✅ Lists gotchas (e.g., "Don't use deprecated API X, use Y instead")
- ✅ Lists things NOT to do (e.g., "Never hardcode API keys")

**Example**:

```markdown
## ⚠️ Constraints & Gotchas

### Technical Requirements

- Node.js version: 18+ (for fetch API support)
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+ (uses JSONB features)

### Common Gotchas

- ❌ Don't use `bcrypt.hashSync()` (blocking) → ✅ Use `bcrypt.hash()` (async)
- ❌ Don't store JWT secret in code → ✅ Use environment variable
- ❌ Don't expose stack traces in production → ✅ Use error sanitization

### Security Requirements

- All passwords must be hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- API keys must be stored in .env (never committed to git)
- Rate limiting: max 5 login attempts per minute per IP
```

**Auto-fix strategy**:

1. Use `mcp__serena__read_file` to check for .env.example, security docs
2. Add standard constraints section using `Edit` tool

## 🔄 Auto-Improvement Loop Algorithm

```python
def validate_prp(prp_path: str) -> ValidationResult:
    """
    Validates and auto-improves PRP using iterative approach.

    Returns:
        ValidationResult with score, issues, fixes_applied, final_status
    """
    MAX_ITERATIONS = 3
    PASS_THRESHOLD = 80  # 80/100 points minimum

    # Step 1: Create backup
    create_backup(prp_path)

    iteration = 0
    previous_score = 0
    fixes_log = []

    while iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS:
        iteration += 1

        # Step 2: Read and score current PRP
        prp_content = read_file(prp_path)
        score = calculate_score(prp_content)
        issues = identify_issues(prp_content, score)

        # Step 3: Check if passing
        if score >= PASS_THRESHOLD:
            return ValidationResult(
                status="PASS",
                score=score,
                iterations=iteration,
                fixes_applied=fixes_log
            )

        # Step 4: Check progress (must improve by at least 10 points)
        if iteration > 1 and (score - previous_score) < 10:
            return ValidationResult(
                status="STALLED",

                message="Auto-improvement stalled. Manual review needed.",
                unfixed_issues=issues
            )

        # Step 5: Auto-fix issues
        fixes = apply_auto_fixes(prp_path, issues)
        fixes_log.extend(fixes)
        previous_score = score

    )
```

---

## 🛠️ Auto-Fix Strategies by Issue Type

### **Issue: Missing "Current vs Desired Structure"**

**Detection**: Search for section headers containing "structure", "before", "after"

**Fix Process**:

1. Use `mcp__serena__list_dir(".", recursive=true)` to get current structure
2. Parse PRP "Implementation Steps" to extract files to be created/modified
3. Generate tree view showing current state
4. Generate tree view showing desired state with 🆕 NEW markers
5. Create "Changes Summary" (added/modified/removed)
6. Insert section after "Goal" or "Overview" section using `Edit` tool

**Template**:

```markdown
## 📁 Project Structure Analysis

### Current Structure (Before Implementation)

[Generated from list_dir]

### Desired Structure (After Implementation)

[Current + new files from implementation steps]

### Changes Summary

- **Added**: [list]
- **Modified**: [list]
- **Removed**: [list]
```

---

### **Issue: Missing External References**

**Detection**: References section exists but has no URLs/external links

**Fix Process**:

1. Extract key technologies from PRP (e.g., "JWT", "PostgreSQL", "Express")
2. Use `mcp__archon__perform_rag_query(query="official docs for [technology]", match_count=3)`
3. Add relevant external docs to References section
4. Use `Edit` tool to insert under "### External Resources"

---

### **Issue: Missing Internal References**

**Detection**: References section has no file paths from current codebase

**Fix Process**:

1. Identify feature type from PRP (e.g., "authentication", "API endpoint", "database")
2. Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern(pattern="similar pattern", relative_path="src/")`
3. Find 2-3 existing files that show similar patterns
4. Add them to References with purpose description
5. Use `Edit` tool to insert under "### Internal Codebase Examples"

---

### **Issue: Vague Business Logic**

**Detection**: Steps contain words like "implement", "add", "create" without specifics

**Fix Process**:

1. For each vague step, use `mcp__server-sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`:
   - Thought 1: What EXACTLY does "implement X" mean?
   - Thought 2: What file(s) are involved?
   - Thought 3: What code structure/classes/functions?
   - Thought 4: What inputs/outputs/behavior?
2. Expand vague step into 3-5 specific sub-steps
3. Add concrete examples/data formats
4. Use `Edit` tool to replace vague step with detailed steps

**Example transformation**:

```markdown
BEFORE (vague):

- Implement user authentication

AFTER (specific):

- Create `src/auth/jwt.js` with two functions:
  - `generateToken(userId: string) → string`: Creates JWT with 24h expiry, HS256 algorithm
  - `verifyToken(token: string) → {userId: string}`: Validates and decodes JWT
- Create `src/middleware/auth.js`:
  - Middleware function that extracts token from Authorization header
  - Calls verifyToken(), attaches userId to req.user
  - Returns 401 if token invalid/missing
- Test data example: `{userId: "123", email: "user@example.com"}`
```

---

### **Issue: Non-Actionable Steps**

**Detection**: Steps don't start with action verbs or lack file paths

**Fix Process**:

1. For each step without action verb → add appropriate verb (Create, Modify, Add, Update, Delete)
2. For each step without file path → use sequential-thinking to infer path or add placeholder with comment
3. Check step dependencies → reorder if needed
4. Use `Edit` tool to restructure

---

## 🔒 Security & Safety Measures

### **1. Backup Before Modify**

- ALWAYS create `.backup-[timestamp]` before any auto-fix
- Format: `PRPs/filename.md.backup-2025-01-06T10-30-45`
- Never overwrite backups

### **2. Scope Limitation**

- ONLY modify files in `PRPs/` directory
- NEVER modify source code (`src/`, `tests/`, etc.)
- NEVER modify config files (`.env`, `package.json`, etc.)

### **3. Dangerous Operations Detection**

If PRP contains potentially dangerous operations, REJECT immediately:

- ❌ "delete production database"
- ❌ "expose API keys"
- ❌ "disable authentication"
- ❌ "rm -rf" or similar destructive commands

**Response**: `⛔ PRP contains potentially dangerous operations. Please review manually.`

### **4. Rate Limiting**

- Max 3 validation iterations per PRP invocation
- If user re-invokes after failure, allow fresh 3 iterations

### **5. Logging & Audit**

Every validation generates log entry in `.claude/logs/prp-validation-[date].log`:

```
[2025-01-06 10:30:45] START: PRPs/auth_feature.md
[2025-01-06 10:30:46] SCORE: 65/100 (initial)
[2025-01-06 10:30:50] AUTO-FIX: Added Current vs Desired Structure
[2025-01-06 10:30:55] AUTO-FIX: Enhanced References
[2025-01-06 10:31:00] SCORE: 90/100 (iteration 1)
[2025-01-06 10:31:01] RESULT: PASS - Ready to execute
```

---

## 📚 Examples

### **Example 1: Perfect PRP (95/100)**

**Input**: Well-structured PRP with all sections

**Validator Action**:

- Scans PRP
- Score: 95/100 (only missing minor constraints section)
- Decision: PASS immediately - skip auto-improvement
- Output: "✅ Excellent PRP quality (95/100). Proceeding to execution..."

---

### **Example 2: Missing Structure Section (65/100)**

**Input**: PRP without "Current vs Desired Structure"

**Validator Action**:

- Iteration 1:
  - Detect missing section (-20 points)
  - Run `list_dir` to get current structure
  - Parse implementation steps to infer desired structure
  - Generate section with tree views + 🆕 markers
  - Insert into PRP
- Re-score: 85/100
- Output: "✅ Added structure comparison. Ready to execute."

---

### **Example 3: Vague Business Logic (50/100)**

**Input**: PRP with steps like "implement authentication" (no specifics)

**Validator Action**:

- Iteration 1:
  - Detect vague steps (-20 points)
  - Use sequential-thinking: "What does implement authentication mean?"
  - Expand into: Create JWT service, Create middleware, Add to routes
  - Re-score: 65/100 (improved but still missing references)
- Iteration 2:
  - Add external reference (JWT.io docs)
  - Search codebase for auth examples
  - Add internal references
  - Re-score: 85/100
- Output: "✅ Clarified business logic + added references. Ready to execute."

---

## 🎯 Integration Points

### **With `/prp-execute` Command**

`.claude/commands/prp/prp-execute.md` should be updated to:

```markdown
You are executing a PRP (Pattern Recognition Protocol).

IMPORTANT: BEFORE executing the PRP, you MUST validate it using @prp-validator.

Workflow:

1. Call @prp-validator with the PRP file path
2. If validation PASSES (score ≥ 80/100):
   - Proceed with PRP execution using @prp-expert
3. If validation FAILS:
   - Show validation report to user
   - Ask if they want to:
     a) Fix issues manually and re-run
     b) Provide additional context for one more validation attempt
     c) Override and execute anyway (NOT recommended)

[Rest of /prp-execute logic...]
```

### **With `/prp-validate` Command (New)**

Create `.claude/commands/prp/prp-validate.md`:

```markdown
Validate a PRP without executing it.

Usage: /prp-validate PRPs/filename.md

This command:

1. Runs @prp-validator on the specified PRP
2. Shows validation score and issues
3. Auto-improves if score < 80/100
4. Stops after validation (does NOT execute)

Use this to check PRP quality before committing to execution.
```

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

If @prp-validator is working correctly:

1. **First-pass PRP execution success rate**: 70-80%+ (up from ~50% without validation)
2. **Reduction in manual rework**: 60%+ (catch errors before generating code)
3. **User confidence**: High (know PRP is solid before execution)
4. **Time saved**: 2-10x (prevent generating 1000+ lines of bad code)

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

Track validation failures to identify new patterns:

- If same issue appears 3+ times → add to auto-fix strategies
- If certain PRP types always fail → create specialized base template
- If validation is too strict → adjust scoring thresholds

---

## 📝 Metadata in Validated PRPs

After successful validation, add metadata comment at top of PRP:

```markdown
<!--
✅ Validated by @prp-validator
Date: 2025-01-06T10:30:45
Score: 90/100
Iterations: 2
Auto-fixes applied: 5
-->
```

This helps track which PRPs have been validated and their quality history.

## 🎓 Learning from Raasmus (Video Insights)

Key principles from "Context Engineering 101" video applied here:

1. **"Read through your PRPs before you run the execute command"** → Automated via validation
2. **"Make sure they are actually following the business logic you intend"** → Business logic specificity check
3. **"Make sure they are not tangled"** → Dependencies and structure clarity check
4. **"Validation is still super important"** → Built into execution workflow
5. **"Context engineering is time investment upfront that 10x's your process"** → Validation is part of that upfront investment
