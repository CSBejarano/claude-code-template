# Validate PRP (No Execution)

## File: $ARGUMENTOS

## Purpose

Validate PRP quality and auto-improve it WITHOUT executing. Use this to:

- Check PRP quality before committing to execution
- Fix common PRP issues automatically
- Understand what needs improvement before running

---

## üîç Validation Process

### 1. Invoke @prp-validator

You will call @prp-validator agent with the specified PRP file path.

### 2. @prp-validator Actions

The validator will:

1. **Read PRP** from specified path
2. **Score PRP** using Pareto 80-20 criteria (0-100 points)
3. **Identify Issues** if score < 80/100
4. **Auto-Improve** PRP (max 3 iterations):
   - Add missing "Current vs Desired Structure" section
   - Enhance references (mix external + internal)
   - Clarify vague business logic
   - Make steps actionable with file paths
5. **Create Backup** at `PRPs/[filename].md.backup-[timestamp]`
6. **Generate Report** with score, issues, fixes applied

### 3. Validation Criteria (Pareto 80-20)

**TIER 1 - CRITICAL (80 points total)**:

- Current vs Desired Structure section (20 pts)
- Mixed references (external + internal) (20 pts)
- Specific business logic (no vague terms) (20 pts)
- Actionable steps with file paths (20 pts)

**TIER 2 - HIGH (20 points total)**:

- Validation gates mentioned (10 pts)
- Clear constraints/gotchas (10 pts)

**Passing Score**: 80/100

## üìä Expected Outputs

### Success Case (Score ‚â• 80/100)

```
üîç Validating PRP: PRPs/feature.md...
üìä Initial Score: 65/100
‚ö†Ô∏è Issues found: [3]

üîß Auto-improving (Iteration 1/3)...
  ‚úÖ Added Current vs Desired Structure
  ‚úÖ Enhanced References
  ‚úÖ Clarified business logic

üìä New Score: 90/100 ‚úÖ
‚úÖ VALIDATION PASSED

üìÑ Report saved to: PRPs/validation_reports/feature_2025-01-06.md
üîô Backup saved to: PRPs/feature.md.backup-2025-01-06T10-30-45
```

### Needs Manual Review (Score < 80 after 3 iterations)

```
üìä Final Score: 72/100 ‚ùå
‚ö†Ô∏è VALIDATION FAILED - Manual review required

Unfixed Issues:
1. Business logic still too vague
2. Missing specific file paths

üí¨ Please:
1. Review improved PRP at PRPs/feature.md
2. Address unfixed issues manually
3. Re-run /prp-validate
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

```bash
# Validate a story PRP
/prp-validate PRPs/story_auth_feature.md
