"""
Integration Tests for Checkpoint Validation.

Tests the CHECKPOINT 1 and CHECKPOINT 2 flows that are critical
for the Context Engineering approach:
- CHECKPOINT 1: After Phase 2 (Intent Analysis) - validate direction before planning
- CHECKPOINT 2: After Phase 7 (Structure Generation) - validate structure before code

Each checkpoint supports 3 user responses:
1. "approve" - Continue to next phase
2. "fix: <changes>" - Adjust and re-present checkpoint
3. "restart" - Start over from Phase 0

These are specification/contract tests that document the expected behavior,
even though full Orchestrator SDK implementation may not be complete.
